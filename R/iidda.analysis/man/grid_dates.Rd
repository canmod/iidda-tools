\title{Create a grid of dates starting at the first day in grid unit}
\usage{
grid_dates(
  start_date = "1920-01-01",
  end_date = "2020-01-01",
  by = "1 week",
  unit = "week",
  lookback = TRUE,
  week_start = 7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_date}{starting date}

\item{end_date}{end date}

\item{by}{increment of the sequence.  Optional.  See \sQuote{Details}.}

\item{unit}{a string, \code{Period} object or a date-time object. When a singleton string,
it specifies a time unit or a multiple of a unit to be rounded to. Valid base units
are \code{second}, \code{minute}, \code{hour}, \code{day}, \code{week}, \code{month}, \code{bimonth}, \code{quarter},
\code{season}, \code{halfyear} and \code{year}. Arbitrary unique English abbreviations as in the
\code{\link[lubridate:period]{period()}} constructor are allowed. Rounding to multiples of units (except weeks)
is supported.

When \code{unit} is a \code{Period} object, it is first converted to a string representation
which might not be in the same units as the constructor. For example \code{weeks(1)} is
converted to "7d 0H 0M 0S". Thus, always check the string representation of the
period before passing to this function.

When \code{unit} is a date-time object rounding is done to the nearest of the
elements in \code{unit}. If range of \code{unit} vector does not cover the range of
\code{x} \code{ceiling_date()} and \code{floor_date()} round to the \code{max(x)} and \code{min(x)}
for elements that fall outside of \code{range(unit)}.}

\item{lookback}{Logical, should the first value start before \code{start_date}}

\item{week_start}{week start day (Default is 7, Sunday. Set \code{lubridate.week.start} to
override). Full or abbreviated names of the days of the week can be in English or
as provided by the current locale.}
