\usage{
iidda_prep_seasonal_heatmap(
  data,
  series_variable = NULL,
  start_time_variable = "period_start_date",
  end_time_variable = "period_end_date",
  time_unit = c("yday", "year"),
  prepend_string = "End ",
  normalize = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame containing time series data}

\item{series_variable}{column name of series variable in \code{data}, default is "deaths"}

\item{start_time_variable}{column name of time variable in \code{data}, default is "period_start_date"}

\item{end_time_variable}{column name of time variable in \code{data}, default is "period_end_date"}

\item{time_unit}{a vector of new time unit fields to create from \code{start_time_variable} and \code{end_time_variable}.
Defaults to "c("yday","year")". The currently functionality expects that both "yday" and "year" are included, should be
made more general to incorporate any of iidda.analysis:::time_units.}

\item{prepend_string}{string to prepend to newly created time_unit fields to distinguish between time_unit
fields corresponding to starting versus ending time periods. Defaults to "End ". For example, a \code{time_unit} of "year"
will create a field name "Year" from \code{start_time_variable} and a field called "End Year" created from \code{end_time_variable}.}

\item{normalize}{boolean flag to normalize \code{series_variable} data to be between 0 and 1.}

\item{...}{optional arguments to \code{year_end_fix()}}
}
\value{
all fields in\code{data} with records prepped for plotting seasonal heatmaps. The name
of the new \code{time_unit} fields will be named from lubridate_funcs.
}
\description{
Prep data for seasonal heatmap plots. Prep steps were taken from \code{LBoM::seasonal_heat_map}
and they include creating additional time unit fields, splitting weeks that cover the
year end,  and optionally normalizing series data to be in the range (0,1).
